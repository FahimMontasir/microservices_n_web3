### Shared Logic Between Services

- What about event-related stuff for the auth service?
- It turns out that no other services really need to know about what the auth service is doing!
- Everything the auth service does is exposed through that JWT in the cookie

### Project Setup

- There might be differences in our TS settings between the common lib and our services - don't want to deal with that
- Services might not be written with TS at all!
- Our common library will be written as Typescript and published as Javascript

```console
cd section-12/ticketing/common
tsc --init
```
