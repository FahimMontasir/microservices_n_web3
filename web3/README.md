1. `Ethereum`:
   The ultimate smart contract and decentralized application platform
2. What is `ethereum`? Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with
   smart contract functionality.
   Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies,
   ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization.
   Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.

5. what is `metamask`:

   1. A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps
   2. Buy, store, send and swap tokens: Available as a browser extension
      and as a mobile app, MetaMask equips you with a key vault, secure login,
      token wallet, and token exchangeâ€”everything you need to manage your digital assets.
   3. MetaMask provides the simplest yet most secure way to connect to blockchain-based
      applications. You are always in control when interacting on the
      new decentralized web.
   4. MetaMask generates passwords and keys on your device, so only you have access to
      your accounts and data. You always choose what to share and what to keep private.
